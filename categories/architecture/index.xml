This was one of the first blog posts I wrote while working at Atomic Object. I don&amp;rsquo;t think my views on the matter have changed much, especially the last section (&amp;ldquo;The Takeaways&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/05/11/categorize-software-errors/ https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/05/12/capturing-representing-errors/ https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/05/13/error-handling-process/  This is a 3-part blog series I wrote while working at Atomic Object. I spent quite a bit of time writing it, and I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely satisfied with the way it turned out. Error handling really is a complicated and important part of programming, and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get it right a lot of the time.
I&amp;rsquo;ll almost definitely be expanding on these ideas in future blog posts.</description>
