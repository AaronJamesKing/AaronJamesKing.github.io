    Root Software offers co-development partnerships for clients with marketable products.
  </p>
  <p class="service-page__prose">
    The idea is simple: If you own a software product that generates at least some regular revenue,
    Root Software will partner with you as a long-term development team at a discounted rate, in exchange for revenue sharing.
  </p>
  <p class="service-page__prose">
    We'll work together to arrange a partnership that's flexible, fair, and utilizes everyone's strengths to
    build the best software product we can.
