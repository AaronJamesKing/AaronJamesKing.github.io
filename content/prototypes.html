    You have a great idea, driven to solve a real-world problem. But you need a tangible application to demonstrate that idea.

  <p class="service-page__prose">
    Vibe coding platforms like Replit are nice, but they have real limitations.

    Root Software will build you a professional prototype quickly and affordably.

  <h2>
    The Process
  </h2>
  <ol class="service-page__list">
    <li>
      <strong>Step 1</strong>: We'll meet virtually or in person to learn about the problem and the software solution you want to build.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 2</strong>: Next, we'll build wireframes to make sure the app feels the way you've been envisioning.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 3</strong>: I'll carefully design a tech stack that's perfect for the prototype. I choose technologies that are proven to be both simple and powerful, instead of whatever just happens to be popular at the moment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 4</strong>: Next comes the implementation. Using modern techniques, this takes less than 10 business days.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 5</strong>: Sweet, sweet delivery. You'll have a working, deployed prototype along with detailed documentation about the product and the underlying technology. We'll do a thorough walkthrough of the application in real time and make sure you know how to approach the next step (market validation).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>
    What's Included in a Prototype?
  </h2>
  <ul class="service-page__list">
    <li>
      A <strong>professionally built web application</strong> (these are ideal for prototyping, unlike native mobile or desktop apps).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Complete documentation</strong> about the product, what it does, how it works, and how it was built.
    </li>
    <li>
      You <strong>completely own every piece of it</strong> - the code, documents, third-party accounts, and credentials.
    </li>
    <li>
      An <strong>automated test suite</strong> to prevent later regressions.
    </li>
    <li>
      A battle-tested <strong>UI component system</strong> such as Material or Bootstrap (we believe custom branding is a distraction during prototyping)
    </li>
  </ul>
