    You're past the prototyping phase and need to test the market viability of an idea. Are you going to spend tens of thousands of dollars on the next implementation before putting it in front of customers? Nope!
  </p>
  <p class="service-page__prose">
    Root Software will build you an MVP designed specifically for iterating and adapting.
  </p>

  <h2>
    The Process
  </h2>
  <ol class="service-page__list">
    <li>
      <strong>Step 1</strong>: We'll meet virtually or in person to gain a thorough understanding about your product and the problem it's solving.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 2</strong>: Next, I'll connect you with a trusted external design team to build a simple and scalable branded design system along with a complete set of wireframes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 3</strong>: I'll thoughtfully craft a tech stack specifically for your product. We choose technologies that are proven to be powerful and scalable, instead of whatever just happens to be popular at the moment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 4</strong>: Next comes the implementation. Root Software works according to the Agile development process: iteratively, with regular demos and feedback, adjusting as necessary. This process takes around 4-8 weeks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 5</strong>: Sweet, sweet delivery. You'll have a fully functioning product, ready to evolve with your business, along with detailed documentation.
    </li>
  </ol>
