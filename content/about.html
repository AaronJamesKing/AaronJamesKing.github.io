  <h1>What is Root Software?</h1>

  <p>We're a <strong>network</strong> of talented software developers, <strong>filling the gaps</strong> for companies that don't have the expertise or resources to manage their own custom software. We do software development and maintenance, consulting, and recruiting. See <a href="/">our services page</a> for more details.</p>

  <h2>How do we do it?</h2>

  <p>By understanding every client's <strong>unique challenges</strong>, and tailoring the <strong>technical solution</strong> and <strong>project management</strong> accordingly.</p>
  <p>Because not every project needs two-week sprints, but some do! And some clients need <strong>dynamic hourly</strong> development, while others need <strong>up-front pricing</strong> and scoping. One might need a <strong>generalist</strong> developer, while another needs a <strong>specialized</strong> expert. But regardless of your specific situation, you can expect <strong>great communication and service</strong> along the way.</p>

  <h2>How can we help?</h2>

  <p>All you need to do is <strong><a href="/contact">get in touch!</a></strong> We give out as much <strong>free</strong> advice as possible. If we aren't the right software partner for you, then we'll try to refer you to an even better match.</p>
