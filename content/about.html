  <h1>What is Root Software?</h1>

  <p>
    I'm Aaron King, the owner and principle consultant here.
    My goal is to help SMBs and startups throughout the Midwest build great software without breaking the bank.
  </p>

  <p>
    I operate Root Software by forming and collaborating with bespoke teams tailored to each client's needs.
  </p>

  <h2>What makes Root Software special?</h2>

  <p>
    If you can believe it, <strong>writing code is usually not the hardest part</strong> of software development.
    The real challenges are identifying the right problems to solve, planning solutions that actually solve them,
    and then handling the unexpected speed bumps throughout development.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why Root Software emphasizes consultation, partnership, and communication, and manages programming
    as just one part of the process. The result is money spent on strategy and architecture instead of
    code that LLMs are commoditizing more and more each day.
  </p>

  <h2>How can Root Software help?</h2>

  <p>All you need to do is <strong><a href="/contact">reach out!</a></strong> I like give out as much free advice as possible. If Root Software isn't the right partner for you, I'll try to refer an even better match.</p>
