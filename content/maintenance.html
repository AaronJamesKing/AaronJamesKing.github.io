    The Process
  </h2>
  <ol class="service-page__list">
    <li>
      <strong>Step 1</strong>: We'll perform a gap analysis between your software as it stands, and the latest versions of the underlying tech. Deprecated or risky dependencies will be identified along the way.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 2</strong>: Together, we'll prioritize maintenance tasks based on urgency, effort, risk, and value.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 3</strong>: Next, we'll help you develop a budget to address the most important tasks without overspending.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 4</strong>: Root Software will work through the list, with frequent communication and testing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Step 5</strong>: When the project is finished, you'll have safe and stable software along with a guide for future maintenance.
    </li>
  </ol>
